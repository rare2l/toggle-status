This project demonstrates a simple webpage design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to handle user input and interact with a MySQL database. The webpage includes a form for submitting names and ages, stores this data in a database, and displays it in a table. A toggle button allows you to change the status of each record between 0 and 1.

Features
	•	Form Submission: A form where users can input their name and age and submit the data.
	•	Database Integration: Submitted data is stored in a MySQL database.
	•	Data Display: All records are displayed in a table below the form.
	•	Status Toggle: A toggle button for each record that switches the status value between 0 and 1.

Task Instructions
	1.	Webpage Design:
	•	Use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for dynamic behavior, and PHP for server-side processing.
	2.	Form Creation:
	•	The form should include fields for name, age, and a submit button.
	3.	Data Storage:
	•	Store the submitted data in a MySQL database table. You can use PHP and MySQL to achieve this.
	4.	Display Data:
	•	All records from the MySQL table should be displayed below the form in a structured table.
	5.	Toggle Button:
	•	Add a toggle button to each record in the table to switch the status value between 0 and 1.
	6.	Immediate Status Update:
	•	After toggling, the updated status should be reflected on the webpage without needing to refresh the page.

How to Use
	1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
	2.	Set up a MySQL database with a table that can store the name, age, and status of each user.
	3.	Update the database connection settings in the PHP script.
	4.	Run the project using a local server like XAMPP or any similar tool.
	5.	Access the webpage, input data in the form, and toggle the status of each record.

Requirements
	•	PHP: 7.0 or higher
	•	MySQL: For database management
	•	JavaScript: For toggling status without page reload
	•	CSS: For styling the webpage
